SVocTrainer (SVT) is a small tool to study your vocabulary for school but you also can study other things like chemistry, math etc.
SVT isn't big and slow yet - it's a really small program (~200 lines), written in Perl without any modules and to use it you only need tools which are available
in every OS: A Perl Distribution, equivalent to Perl >= 5.8, a text editor and a CLI (Command Line Interface) like cmd.exe or bash, sh, ksh, whatever you want. 

###### Start SVT ######

The recommended paramter syntax to call SVT is as following:

$ ./SVocTrainer DB MODE LANGUAGE [ORDER]

- "DB" is the name of the text file in which the vocabulary is stored. See section "The Vocabulary DB". You always have to type this argument.
- "MODE" is the mode in which SVT works:
	- "t" :: [T]raining mode. SVT asks you the vocabulary in the direction you choose with the argument LANGUAGE.
	- "d" :: [D]ictionary. You can formulate queries to the vocabulary db. If you type in the prompt "ef", SVT finds all words stored in the with LANGUAGE chosen language containing "ef".
- "LANGUAGE" is the language you are asked or you ask (by) SVT:
	- "1" is the argument for the first column in the db. SVT asks you for the word in column 1 displaying the related word of column 2.
	- "2" is the argument for the second column in the db. SVT asks you for the word in column 2 displaying the related word of column 1.
	- "b" is only useful for the [d]ictionary mode. "b" stands for "bidirectional" and makes it possible to ask in the d-mode both columns for strings (like "ef" in the example above).
- "ORDER" is the Order argument and only useful for the [t]raining mode. It says svt if you want to be asked in a linear or a random order.
	- "o" (in future "l") asks you the first, second, third, fourd... word pair.
	- "r" asks you the words in a random order.
