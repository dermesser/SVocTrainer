DOCUMENTATION FOR "SVoctrainer"
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

This is the documentation for the perl program (yes, I find we should call it a program, it doesn't have got features that a script has got) SVocTrainer.
SVocTrainer stands for Simple Vocabulary Trainer which completely describes this program. It's a really simple vocabulary trainer, without features like
- a GUI
- big DB-Systems like MySQL
- slowness
- fussiness...

SVoctrainer uses standard text files for storing the vocabulary. You only need a normal text editor supporting UTF-8 and iso-8859-1 and UNIX line breaks. Then you write a file formatted as following:

================= <EXAMPLE> ================

# Comments are ignored
# Also empty lines are ignored

# The you have to write the vocabulary as l1=l2:
l1=l2
vim=editor
windows=hah?
linux=iloveit
sourceforge=genial
# Some comments in the vocabulary can structure the file
me=dermesser
perl=programming language
umlaute=möglich
street=Straße
# More vocabulary lasts longer at reading by the program

================= </EXAMPLE> ===============

To use the script, save your vocabulary in a file, e.g. 'vocs_test.txt', and type into your shell:

$ ./SVocTrainer.pl vocs_test.txt

Then the script starts and asks you which mode to use. Here you can choose:

'd' or 'dictionary' - this mode allows you to ask the vocabulary database.
't' or 'trainer'    - this mode asks you the words. 

At the current version of the program you have only to type the language direction for training mode:

'trainer l1'  - if you type 'trainer l1' the program asks you the vocabulary in the l2 column and you have to type the l1 words. Example (see the table above)

===== BEGIN SVOCTRAINER OUTPUT =====
1/9: l2? >                  ### Here you have to type 'l1' ###
2/9: editor? >              ### and here you type 'vim'    ###
3/9: hah? >                 ### right, here you have to type 'windows' ###
===== END SVOCTRAINER OUTPUT =====


+++++++++ ADDITIONAL NOTICES ++++++++

* Coding of the vocabulary DB: UTF-8 is recommended for standard perl and bash >=3.00
* For standard perl, the line break of all used files has to be UNIX/LINUX, not mac, not dos. If you have to modify the line break, use mac2unix, dos2unix...
* For more questions write a mail to <der.messer@web.de> (Development and documentation)
* If you find a bug or a fault in the Documentation, the program or elsewhere, send an email to <falconl@ymail.com> or, which is better, to both <falconl@ymail.com> and <der.messer@web.de>.
